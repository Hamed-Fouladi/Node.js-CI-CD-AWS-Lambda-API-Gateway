# Node.js-CI-CD-AWS-Lambda-API-Gateway

This is a very simple Node app that does basically nothing except for the "Hello world" output.
But when you commit to the main branch, the Action Pipeline is launched, which in turn collects everything you need to run the code and outputs “Hello World”.

It is also planned to run the application in AWS Lambda so that when called through the API Gateway through a browser, it displays “Hello World”.
